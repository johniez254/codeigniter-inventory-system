What is CodeIgniter
###################

CodeIgniter is an Application Development Framework - a toolkit - for people
who build web sites using PHP. Its goal is to enable you to develop projects
much faster than you could if you were writing code from scratch, by providing
a rich set of libraries for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple
interface and logical structure to access these libraries. CodeIgniter lets
you creatively focus on your project by minimizing the amount of code needed
for a given task.

###################
Installing the IMS
###################
 
One is required to follow the instruction/or procedures as shown in the installation above for Adobe Dreamweaver and Xampp Server. The installation of the above enables the system to have PHP and MySQL installed in the directory; C:\Xampp directory and all other program files.

#######################
Running the IMS Project
#######################

i)	Copy the folder containing the project and paste it in the folder named htdocs directory found in Xampp Server. 	This is the default publishing folder i.e. C:\Xampp\htdocs for all systems installed using Xampp Server 3.2.2.

ii)	Once the project files are pasted into the htdocs directory, open the folder that is in there which contains 		the project files.

iii)Go to the Xampp application, start Xampp. On Xampp control panel, start Apache and MySQL services by clicking the buttons.

iv)	To set up the database environment, go to your htdocs folder (named inventory), select the folder with the 			project and drag it to your browser then change the link URL to <http://localhost /inventory/>. This will be 		able to redirect to the IMS installation wizard. Just follow the prompts of installation providing the 				hostname, username, database name, and password.
